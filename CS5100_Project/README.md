# CS5100_Project

Project for CS5100 Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University.	
The final project should be an application of some are of AI to a problem of interest
to you.

Group Problem Statement:

Through the use of historical data, mathematical models, and machine learning, our group 
aims to predict short term fluctuations within the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on a 
given day, assuming no major anomalies which impact the performance of a stock. More 
specifically, we wish to analyze stock information provided through the use of yfinance 0.1.77, 
which offers a threaded and pythonic way of downloaded market data from Yahoo Finance. The goal, 
as mentioned, is to predict the short-term future value of stocks in order to determine investment 
decisions.

Instructions for running ARIMA Code:
The best way to run the ARIMA code is to open the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) and run each section
seperately. However for sake of convience, a standard Python file (.py) is provided as well. Please 
note it is necessary to have all packaged listed at the top of the file installed in order to run the
model.
